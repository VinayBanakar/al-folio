<h3>Hello there!</h3>
I am Vinay, a Senior Systems Engineer at Hewlett Packard Enterprise RnD Labs and a remote Research Fellow at Systems and Storage Lab, Univeristy of Texas at Austin under the guidance of [Prof. Vijay Chidambaram](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/){:target="\_blank"}. I am also currently working with [Dr Kimberly Keeton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Keeton){:target="\_blank"} on Gen-Z persistent fabric-attached memory applications.

My research interest is computer systems: data intensive distributed computing systems, storage systems, data privacy and large scale resource (compute, network and storage) orchestration in datacenters. Especially, my recent work focuses on designing and building benchmarks for persistent fabric attached memory architecture, determining the impact of privacy regulations on storage systemâ€™s design and performance by building a benchmarking tool, and finally designing and implementing intent driven hardware provisioning and placement algorithms.
