<h3><strong>Hello!</strong></h3>
I am Vinay, a first-year graduate student in the [Computer Sciences Department](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at [The University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/){:target="\_blank"}

Previously, I was a Systems Engineer at Hewlett Packard Enterprise RnD Labs and a remote Research Fellow at [Systems and Storage Lab](https://utsaslab.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}, [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/){:target="\_blank"} under the guidance of [Prof. Vijay Chidambaram](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/){:target="\_blank"}. 

In the past, I have collaborated with [Dr. Kimberly Keeton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Keeton){:target="\_blank"} [[Gen-Z persistent fabric-attached memory](http://openfam.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}], [Prof. Supreeth Shastri](https://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~sshastri/){:target="\_blank"} and [Prof. Arun Kumar](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~arunkk/){:target="\_blank"} [GDPRBench].

My research interest is **computer systems**: <br>Storage, Operating systems, Distributed systems and systems ML.


<!-- data privacy and large scale resource (compute, network and storage) orchestration in datacenters. Especially, my recent work focuses on designing and building benchmarks for persistent fabric attached memory architecture, determining the impact of privacy regulations on storage systemâ€™s design and performance by building a benchmarking tool, and finally designing and implementing intent driven hardware provisioning and placement algorithms. -->
